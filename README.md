# Maze For Waze

This is an OOP project in the second year of Ariel University's Computer Science course. 

Overview:
This project includes two parts to it
1) A representation of a polynomial function.
2) A representation of directed weighted graphs.

Both polynom and graphs can be drawn to the screen, changed dynamically and have functions supporting them.
